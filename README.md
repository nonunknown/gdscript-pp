# Very Early Project

GDPP (GDScript++) Is a language that is a mix of GDScript and C++

## Description

* Converts GDScript to C++ (GDNATIVE)
* Can use pure c++ code inside gdpp
* Can use c++ built-in types as gdscript like code

## Updates

* Source Code detection system was rewritten for better readability
* Now instead of entire source code splitting the program reads line by line to translate into cpp
* Added Output tab
* Compile button renamed to Convert (Which makes more sense)
* Started auto completion system (can be tested when typing `func name(`
